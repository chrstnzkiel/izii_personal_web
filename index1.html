        <h1>My College Course and School</h1>
        <p> I’m <u>Christian Ezekiel</u>, you can also call me Izii. A <strong><u>first-year student</u></strong> in the <strong><u>Bachelor of Science</u> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science" target="_blank" style="color: gold;"><strong>Computer Science</strong></a></strong> program with a focus on at  Data Science at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/perpetualmolino" target="_blank" style="color: gold;"><strong>University of Perpetual Help System DALTA - Molino Campus</strong></a>. As I begin this journey, I’m excited about diving into data science and learning how to use data to solve real-world problems and drive innovation. While I’m particularly interested in data science, I’m also keen to explore different areas within computer science. My passion lies in learning everything about computers in creative and engaging ways. The opportunity to analyze large datasets and make impactful decisions is both fascinating and motivating.</p>
